# Current milestone and validation evidence

This document is the detailed engineering ledger for the current implementation.
For setup and first use, start with the [project README](../README.md). See
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for stable design rules and
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for pending acceptance gates. Active protocol,
rendering, and ownership corrections are tracked in the
[algorithm improvement plan](ALGORITHM_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md).

Local tests, independent fixtures, and external interoperability are reported
separately. A locally implemented feature remains pending until its required
external gate is complete. The repository-backed Apple/container QEMU gate now
covers a booted arm64 guest plus live Main, Display, Cursor, Inputs, and selected
Agent behavior, including system-trusted TLS.

## Algorithm plan execution

- AIP-00c resumed after the Mac session was unlocked. The dedicated
  `spice-live-interaction` AppKit executable now has live schema-2 evidence that
  binds one direct-session click and unique guest marker through the exact
  SwiftSpice frame identity, selected-ready, selection, Metal commit, and
  actual AppKit presented callback. The pre-atomic Rocky run at
  `/home/beribeli/swiftspice-aip00b/perf-ab/logs/20260829T141056Z.dWq0dC`
  produced ten valid records; its ready-to-selection p50/p95 was
  0.039/8.044 ms. The guest marker now builds its complete binary grid in one
  native `XImage` and publishes one `XPutImage`, removing the per-cell
  foreground/fill request pairs. The adjacent atomic-marker run at
  `/home/beribeli/swiftspice-aip00b/perf-ab/logs/20260830T011820Z.L5b0o6`
  produced seven valid records with ready-to-selection p50/p95/max
  0.041/0.043/0.043 ms, while input-to-presented p50/p95 remained
  125.466/213.059 ms. This means the older one-tick tail is not sufficient
  evidence for an AIP-44 pacing change. `presentedTime == 0` is rejected as a
  dropped drawable; one bounded authoritative latest-only retry is allowed
  without idle commits or exceeding two GPU commands in flight. Eight further
  cold starts still reached two commits with no presented callback and failed
  before arm. AIP-00d now serializes a fixed click/key/motion cluster in one
  visible Session and admits the next action only after exact presentation and
  remote append. Rocky run
  `/home/beribeli/swiftspice-aip00b/perf-ab/logs/20260830T021418Z.037hAL`
  retained successful cluster `0000000000000008`: all three schema-2 records
  are valid, with directional input-to-presented times 197.254/107.894/216.268
  ms and ready-to-selection times 0.010/8.195/0.012 ms for click/key/motion.
  Markerless drawable retries no longer contaminate a later exact marker;
  relative motion alone requires the SPICE motion ACK, while absolute tablet
  motion is closed by guest marker and exact-presented evidence. AIP-00 is
  still in progress: direct Session inputs bypass AppKit receipt, and ten
  paired click/key/motion clusters for `v0.2.7` and current `v0.3.x` remain
  required. AIP-00e now rejects the paired artifact unless it contains exactly
  ten canonical clusters, two exact versions, 20 unique runs arranged as
  adjacent same-cluster pairs with exactly five baseline-first and five
  candidate-first pairs, and 60 valid plan-derived click/key/motion records. It
  reports Hyndman-Fan type-7 p50/p95 plus same-cluster signed deltas; complete
  CPU/RSS samples are
  independent guardrails and never filter latency records. The strict focused
  gate passed 11 tests / 29 parameterized cases. An unchanged `v0.2.7`
  `2c577d7` worktree also completed a Release build under the current Swift 6.3
  toolchain. Its exact-correlation measurement overlay and the live paired
  collection are the next AIP-00 gates; no AIP-44 pacing change is admitted.
  That isolated overlay is now split across stacked PRs #53-#55: exact
  presenter-owned correlation, canonical JSONL/campaign planning, and the
  foreground `v0.2.7` executable. Their combined review-fix gate passed the
  four focused suites 33/33 in strict Debug, strict Release, and
  AddressSanitizer, plus the strict Release product build. The stack remains
  measurement-only and does not import current scheduling or drawable-recovery
  algorithms into the baseline.

- Two subsequent baseline smoke campaigns produced no admissible interaction
  observation. Campaign `2aacf4a6e32fb809` stopped before executable launch
  after the readiness probe rejected an otherwise bindable SSH forward. Fresh
  campaign `322ad5e20a210030` verified the Rocky container and visible AppKit
  subscription, then stopped at `initial_presentation` with one Metal commit,
  zero presented callbacks, no armed input, and an empty remote JSONL file.
  This is a pre-arm reliability failure, not latency data. AIP-00f therefore
  adds only a once-bounded authoritative-latest request after visible demand,
  a real post-baseline commit, and still-zero presentations 250 ms after the
  harness first observes that commit. Baseline and candidate use the same
  duration and start event. The request remains outside trace creation and must
  still time out fail-closed. A new campaign identity will not start until that
  deterministic gate and exact-head review pass.

- AIP-00g is now merged on PRs #59-#60 as main commit `21ed862`. The pure
  package gate fixes ten adjacent paired clusters, 20 fresh-boot runs with a
  five/five counterbalanced version order, 13 successful stages per run and a
  260-entry ledger, exactly 60 canonical valid records, 20 finite CPU/RSS
  samples, and 20 unique typed RemoteRocky evidence IDs. Any failed,
  incomplete, missing, duplicate, reordered, noncanonical, mismatched, or extra
  input is terminal; there is no automatic retry or evidence replacement.
  Focused Debug, Release, and AddressSanitizer gates passed 8/8, and Apple
  Silicon CI run `33306335910` passed build, full tests, AddressSanitizer, and
  coverage with no exact-head review findings. This is structural validation,
  not live evidence. AIP-00h must still persist real-time stages and an atomic
  artifact manifest, sequence the immutable plan, and own RemoteRocky/process
  effects before a new 20-run campaign starts. AIP-00 and AIP-44 remain open;
  no latency improvement is claimed.

- AIP-00h1 is now merged on PRs #62-#63 as main commit `c508718`. The
  real-time recorder owns one exclusive recording manifest, validates each
  candidate through the existing campaign state machine, synchronously writes
  exactly one canonical generation, and only then swaps its in-memory state.
  Persistence uncertainty poisons the recorder; reopen converts a durable
  recording prefix to a terminal interruption, while failed, interrupted, and
  finalized manifests are re-synced before recovery returns. The writer uses a
  private mode-0600 regular file, bounded canonical JSON, in-process and
  cross-process locking, generation CAS, component-wise `openat`/
  `O_NOFOLLOW`, and temp-fsync/rename/directory-fsync publication. Two review
  P2s were fixed test-first: uncertain terminal recovery now closes the
  directory-sync window, and full plan replay rejects a foreign campaign
  ledger entry before replacement. Focused strict Debug, Release, and
  AddressSanitizer passed 10/10; final CI run `33314950299` passed build,
  public API, full tests, AddressSanitizer, and coverage, and exact-head review
  found no issues. This is local persistence closure, not live evidence.
  AIP-00h2 must next bind Release binaries, runner, remote image/guest build,
  fixture/control sources, pointer mode, and stage protocol in a typed
  execution contract; then add the ACK-gated runner, atomic artifact index,
  structured RemoteRocky adapter, baseline overlay, and real paired campaign.
  AIP-00 and AIP-44 remain open, with no latency improvement claimed.

- AIP-00h2a is now merged on PRs #65-#66 as main commit `381e31e`. Manifest
  schema 2 requires an immutable 15-field execution contract covering both
  Release binaries and source commits, the runner, remote image and guest
  build, fixture and control inputs, pointer mode, and typed stage protocol.
  Missing, null, duplicate, aliased, conflicting, or noncanonical identities
  fail closed. Historical schema-1 classification is read-only and preserves
  bytes, inode, mode, size, mtime, and directory entries, including the prior
  writer's literal-slash encoding. The slash compatibility defect found in
  review was fixed test-first. Strict local Debug and Release passed 17/17,
  the AddressSanitizer contract suite passed 7/7, and the Release live product
  built. Combined Apple Silicon CI run `33321040969` passed build, public API,
  full tests, AddressSanitizer, and coverage in 16m21s; exact combined-head
  review found no issue, all three historical threads are resolved, and none
  remain unresolved. This is local identity/admission closure only. AIP-00h2b
  must next add bounded canonical stage events and persist-before-ACK gating;
  duplex processes, RemoteRocky, resource samples, atomic artifacts, baseline
  overlay, and the real paired campaign remain h2c/h2d. AIP-00 and AIP-44
  remain open, with no Rocky, external-SPICE, latency, CPU/RSS, or release
  improvement claimed.

- AIP-00h2b1 is now merged on PRs #68-#69 as main commit `1d3674f`. The local
  stage protocol admits only canonical single-line v1 frames of at most 4 KiB
  and binds the full campaign/run/evidence/action/stage/sequence/manifest-
  generation identity. The durable gate enforces the exact nine child stages,
  creates a pending ACK only after synchronous manifest persistence, and
  advances only after exact ACK delivery. Invalid identity or order, replay,
  stale generation, persistence uncertainty, ACK failure, EOF, and cancellation
  are terminal with zero retry and at most one durable terminal successor. The
  10-test suite includes 79 malformed event/ACK frames. Four review findings
  strengthened all 15 ACK fields, meaningful oversized JSON, repeated no-retry
  persistence proof, and EOF/cancel without a pending ACK; each was fixed
  test-first, replied to, and resolved. Local Debug, Release, and focused ASan
  passed 10/10, with h1/h2a regression for an independently verified 47/47.
  Combined Apple Silicon CI run `33326178174` passed build, public API, full
  tests, AddressSanitizer, and coverage in 17m49s; exact combined-head review
  found no issue and unresolved threads are zero. This is local codec/gate
  closure only. AIP-00h2b2 must next add a Sendable transport abstraction and
  single-reader driver; actual duplex FDs/processes, fixture teardown, `wait4`,
  artifacts, SSH/RemoteRocky, baseline overlay, and paired execution remain
  h2c/h2d. No live SPICE, latency, CPU/RSS, release, or AIP-44 improvement is
  claimed.

- AIP-00h2b2 is now merged on PRs #71-#72 as main commit `3e69c03`. A
  Sendable closure-backed transport and single-reader actor driver now carry
  each canonical event through synchronous durable gate acceptance, exact ACK
  transmission, and delivery confirmation. Run-task cancellation terminates
  receive or send operations that only unblock on close; cancellation wins
  over a simultaneous nil receive, and transport errors cannot impersonate the
  driver's internal control-flow errors. The focused gate passed 16 tests / 28
  executions in strict Debug, strict Release, and AddressSanitizer.
  Cancellation-to-nil passed 20/20 repetitions and all nine driver-error
  impersonation cases failed closed. Three Sources review findings were fixed
  test-first, replied to, and resolved. Combined Apple Silicon CI run
  `33337686652`, job `99327451720`, passed build, public API, full tests,
  AddressSanitizer, and coverage in 17m9s; exact combined-head review of
  `3ab4a2e` found no issue and unresolved threads are zero. This is local
  transport/driver closure only. No actual FD/process/SSH/RemoteRocky,
  artifact, live SPICE, latency, CPU/RSS, release, or AIP-44 improvement is
  claimed by this slice.

- AIP-00h2c-1 is now merged on PRs #74 and #77 as main commit `5a91fac`.
  The Darwin socket transport owns one descriptor, configures
  `SO_NOSIGPIPE`, preserves bounded canonical LF framing with EINTR retry and
  write-all offsets, and admits one receive plus one send. Explicit async close
  uses shutdown to unblock admitted workers and defers raw close until they
  drain; deinitialization may directly raw-close only when no worker is active.
  Both paths claim raw close exactly once. Repeated close and later reuse of
  the same descriptor number cannot affect a new owner. The final AGENTS.md
  simplification removed speculative
  scripted-operation watchdogs and a production test observer while retaining
  real FD and blocked-worker failure cleanup. Focused strict Debug, Release,
  AddressSanitizer, and ThreadSanitizer each passed 11 tests / 30 executions;
  ThreadSanitizer passed 20 repetitions; related h1/h2a/h2b1/h2b2 regression
  passed 43 tests in Debug and Release; and the Release interaction product
  built. Combined Apple Silicon CI run `33351342144`, job `99365206363`,
  passed every gate in 13m51s, and exact combined-head review found no issue.
  AIP-00h2c-2 and h2c-3 are now closed below; h2d is the next boundary for
  baseline-overlay plus real paired Rocky execution. This slice starts no
  child process and provides no `wait4`, artifact, SSH/RemoteRocky, live SPICE,
  latency, CPU/RSS, release, or AIP-44 improvement evidence.

- AIP-00h2c-2 is now merged on PRs #79 and #80 as main commit `f6dedd2`.
  `SpiceLiveProcessGroup` atomically creates an independent child process
  group with an empty signal mask, converges concurrent `finish()` and
  `cancel()` calls on one lifecycle, validates ownership before group signals,
  performs bounded TERM-to-KILL cleanup including leader-first exit, and
  publishes one cached terminal result from one EINTR-safe `wait4` plus copied
  Sendable resource scalars. Six real-process tests preserve bounded cleanup
  through assertion and external-reap failure paths. Exact combined-head CI
  run `33367824639`, job `99412152419`, passed every gate in 14m00s; exact
  review of `a588b85` was clean. Three C findings removed ten net lines of
  duplicate state. An unbounded post-reap cleanup owner remained D because no
  reproducible signalable leak was provided and repeated group signaling after
  leader reap creates PGID-reuse risk. AIP-00h2c-3 is now closed below; h2d is
  the next boundary. This slice contains no artifact, SSH/RemoteRocky, live
  SPICE, latency, CPU/RSS acceptance, release, or AIP-44 improvement claim.

- AIP-00h2c-3 is now merged on PRs #82 and #83 as main commit `a56c890`.
  One exclusive private directory owner binds the fixed canonical run records
  and envelopes, resource samples, successful teardown results, finalized
  manifest, aggregate report, and success index. Manifest and artifact I/O
  retain the same directory inode; success revalidates every fixed run object
  and publishes the index last. Post-record evidence mutation and original-path
  replacement fail terminally without scanning, recovery, retry, or synthesized
  success. Focused strict Debug, Release, and AddressSanitizer each passed 9
  tests / 15 executions. Combined Apple Silicon CI run `33377358455`, job
  `99441731841`, passed every gate in 18m54s; exact review of `ba854ca` was
  clean, and both review-found Sources threads were resolved. The complete h2c
  local execution boundary is closed. AIP-00h2d must next add structured SSH,
  tunnel, fixture, baseline-overlay, and real paired Rocky execution. This
  slice provides no live SPICE, latency, CPU/RSS acceptance, release, or
  AIP-44 improvement claim.

- AIP-00h2d-2 now has local script identity validation on top of the h2d-1
  lease in PRs #85/#86. Six canonical fields are persisted in the existing
  private run configuration before launch and checked with container, image,
  and ports under the lifecycle lock before status or stop. The recorded
  container ID binds subsequent operations, rejecting same-name replacements.
  Bound starts refuse an existing container; unset identity variables preserve
  legacy behavior. Eight new script tests cover the identity round-trip,
  invalid input before effects, foreign or
  corrupt recorded identity, legacy and replacement endpoint protection, and
  a reproduced guest-manifest field collision. Review regressions also cover
  startup name reuse before ownership and failed teardown of a renamed
  container. The final strict Debug suite passed 877 tests; focused
  AddressSanitizer passed twelve script/lease tests.
  This is deterministic local evidence, not a live SSH or paired-campaign
  result. The next support boundary is recorded below; AIP-00 and AIP-44
  remain open.

- AIP-00h2d-3 adds bounded execution to the remote fixture lease and a scoped
  foreground SSH tunnel. Commands claim their lease operation before launch,
  reject concurrent effects, persist success before advancing, and fail
  durably without retry on uncertain results. Tunnel startup waits for a fixed
  SSH forwarding callback; SSH exit aborts the running operation, and every
  return joins socket close and process-group teardown. A bounded `ssh -G`
  preflight rejects inherited forwards before connecting; real OpenSSH tests
  cover local, remote, and dynamic forwarding. Local real-child tests
  cover structured arguments, durable results, failure, cancellation, and
  process reaping using an SSH stand-in. The campaign CLI/child stage-protocol
  wiring, isolated baseline overlay, and real 20-boot/60-action campaign are
  still pending. This slice makes no live SSH, performance, or AIP-44 claim.

- AIP-42 is complete on PR #47. Playback now pulls from a fixed-capacity PCM
  ring and publishes staged packet metadata or an O(1) overflow bank swap under
  the short realtime gate; it no longer schedules one `AVAudioPCMBuffer` and
  completion task per packet. Capture reuses fixed 1,024-frame conversion
  chunks, supports larger interleaved and planar Core Audio callbacks, and
  materializes packet `Data` only through a two-phase async dequeue lease.
  Queue ownership is bounded to 16 MiB and 262,144 slots, with one additional
  16 MiB playback staging bank. The 38-test focused gate passed in Debug,
  Release, ThreadSanitizer, and AddressSanitizer; Apple Silicon CI run
  `33247879206` passed build, public API, full tests, complete AddressSanitizer,
  and coverage. This closes the deterministic allocation and movement gate
  without claiming measured audio latency or device performance; real-device
  behavior remains part of AIP-90.

- AIP-43 is complete on PR #48. Blocking WebDAV filesystem work now runs on a
  width-two executor with 64-job and 256 MiB retained-storage limits. One
  client's filesystem operations and complete response sends remain ordered,
  while unrelated clients overlap; close, cancellation, failed delivery,
  Session identity changes, and same-ID filesystem or suspended-sender
  retirement suppress stale work with exactly-once accounting. `HEAD` is
  metadata-only with exact `Content-Length`; depth-one `PROPFIND` enumerates
  lazily, stops at the response limit, and retains at most 4,096 child
  fragments. The existing synchronous public API is unchanged. Focused WebDAV
  Debug and Release gates passed 20/20, and the related 33-execution filter
  passed under ThreadSanitizer and AddressSanitizer. Apple Silicon CI run
  `33251870601`, job `99098817923`, passed build, public API, full tests,
  AddressSanitizer, and coverage in 11m45s; exact implementation-head review
  found no major issue after all three successor P1 threads were fixed, replied
  to with source/test evidence, and resolved, and all four retained Draft #35
  constraints were rechecked. This is a deterministic completion only; no
  throughput or live-interoperability claim is made before AIP-90.

- AIP-10 is locally complete. Full-header messages are first validated as one
  owned physical batch, then list submessages are dispatched in wire-list order
  before the optional main-message prefix. `SPICE_MSG_LIST` itself is not
  exposed as a logical protocol message.
- Submessage bodies are ranges into the physical body owner. Parsing rejects
  more than 4,096 entries, truncation, checked-arithmetic overflow, metadata or
  main-prefix references, and duplicate or overlapping records before any
  logical message is delivered.
- ACK flow control now counts one unit per physical message across all active
  channels. An empty list dispatches no fake logical message but still completes
  its physical ACK unit.
- Focused AIP-10 evidence is `InboundMessageBatchTests` (9 tests, including 14
  malformed-list argument cases) and `ChannelConnectionBatchTests` (3 tests),
  plus the successful Apple Silicon SwiftPM CI on PR #20.
- AIP-11 is locally complete. Full and implicit-mini serials advance once per
  physical message only after every logical handler and required ACK succeed.
  Empty lists complete immediately without a fake logical message.
- Handler or transport failure, run-task cancellation, and connection close
  terminate unsatisfied waiters for that channel. Waiter cancellation and an
  unrelated channel failure remain isolated. A recoverable migration request
  completes its physical serial without poisoning the source connection. If
  that MIGRATE message reaches the ACK window, its protocol ACK is still sent
  after migration state begins while ordinary client sends remain blocked.
- Focused AIP-11 evidence is `ProcessedSerialBarrierTests` (16 tests), the
  combined serial-barrier selection (19 tests), the AIP-10 batch regression
  (12 tests), `ChannelMigrationTests` (5 tests), `SpiceSessionTests` (61 tests),
  `DisplayChannelTests` (50 tests), and the full warnings-as-errors test gate.
  Replacement connections retain
  their processed-serial barrier when superseded receive tasks unwind, while
  already-started Agent byte streams drain on their captured retiring connection
  before its transport closes; later target sends do not extend that retirement
  fence. Disconnect cancels the retirement waiter, closes its retained source,
  and suppresses a late migration-completed event. Terminal connections reject
  raw and typed client sends without writing. Live peer closure remains part of
  AIP-90.
- AIP-23 is locally complete. When IOSurface is canonical and Data is stale,
  fill, same-Surface COPY_BITS, bitmap DRAW_COPY, and dual-canonical
  cross-Surface DRAW_COPY run against an in-place unleased slot or a synchronized
  immutable candidate. A held published lease remains byte-exact and pool
  exhaustion falls back atomically to Data.
- Candidate synchronization is the only suspension point in the direct CPU
  path. Surface operation locks plus lifecycle/revision/current-identity checks
  guard the commit, and unsafe pointers remain inside synchronous IOSurface lock
  closures. Internal catch-up damage resets at direct commit; publication damage
  survives mismatched requests and is consumed exactly once by a matching
  snapshot.
- Focused AIP-23 evidence is six tests / nine parameter cases,
  `SurfaceStoreTests` 46/46, AddressSanitizer `SurfaceStoreTests` 46/46,
  `SurfacePublicationDamageTests` 3/3, `DisplayChannelTests` 71/71, and the full
  Swift 6 warnings-as-errors test gate. The pre-fix focused gate produced 24
  issues; all are closed on PR #26. No throughput claim is made before AIP-00.
- AIP-30 is locally complete. `OwnedBytes` and checked `WireSlice` ranges carry
  immutable receive ownership across actors, while non-escaping Swift `Span`
  views perform synchronous scalar parsing. Production channels pass slices;
  Display payloads materialize Data only at their existing codec boundaries.
- `MessageFramer` now uses a bounded head-index segment queue. Contiguous bodies
  copy zero bytes, fragmented bodies coalesce once, consumed owners release
  immediately, and received bytes are never compacted. A malformed batch is
  validated before cursor advancement and a retry neither consumes its physical
  boundary nor repeats its coalescing copy.
- The receive queue independently caps live segments at 4,096, closing the
  tiny-read owner-allocation amplification identified by latest-head review.
  The limit is checked before owner allocation, failure does not change bytes,
  diagnostics, or cursor state, and consumed/reset slots immediately restore
  capacity.
- Focused AIP-30 evidence includes `MessageFramerTests` 13 declarations / 18
  executions, `SpiceWireTests` 35 declarations / about 53 executions,
  `SpiceProtocolTests` 46/46, `ChannelConnectionBatchTests` 3/3,
  `DisplayChannelTests` 71 declarations / 84 executions, focused ASan, generated
  source and Public API checks, and the full Swift 6 warnings-as-errors gate.
  Independent tests caught and closed physical-boundary consumption, a segment
  boundary trap, hidden retention of consumed owners, and unbounded live segment
  metadata. No throughput claim is made before AIP-00.

## Stage B local closure

- Swift 6 actor-based TCP and TLS transport using Network.framework.
- System certificate validation by default and an explicitly named insecure
  policy reserved for tests.
- Caller-anchored private PKI supports both modern hostname/SAN/EKU validation
  and an explicit virt-viewer-compatible full `host-subject` policy for legacy
  certificates. Fixed-date local fixtures cover chain, subject, and validity
  failures; the reported real Ravada endpoint remains an external acceptance
  gate.
- SPICE Link handshake, Full/Mini header negotiation, and ticket authentication.
- RSA-OAEP-SHA1 ticket encryption with the reference trailing NUL convention.
- Main Init, Attach Channels, Channel List, Ping/Pong, and ACK flow control.
- ChannelFactory authenticates every discovered channel with the Main session ID.
- Session-scoped credential storage supplies per-channel temporary password
  copies and clears retained bytes when the Session disconnects or fails.
- Disconnect and cancellation during channel attachment close Main, attached,
  and currently attaching transports.
- `spice-probe` provides the TCP/TLS integration entrypoint.

## Stage B live QEMU closure

- Apple/container 1.2 ran an arm64 QEMU 8.2.2 endpoint with KVM using a custom
  Linux 6.18.5 kernel built from Apple containerization 0.40.1. `/dev/kvm` and
  the KVM guest virtual-timer interrupt were present inside the container.
- Host loopback publishing connected `127.0.0.1:15930` to the container SPICE
  listener. A correct ticket completed Main Init and Channel List; an incorrect
  ticket was rejected by QEMU with code 7.
- The live Main transcript reported Display type 2 id 0, Cursor type 4 id 0,
  and Inputs type 3 id 0.
- A self-signed container TLS listener completed the same handshake with the
  explicitly test-only insecure trust policy. No certificate was installed in
  the macOS system or user trust store.
- A system-trust connection to that untrusted certificate now surfaces its
  terminal TLS trust error instead of hiding it behind the 10-second
  establishment timeout. A silent peer that never completes TLS still follows
  the bounded timeout path; both state paths have local regression coverage.
- After explicit authorization, a one-day local CA was temporarily installed as
  a trust root in the login keychain. macOS SSL evaluation accepted its
  IP-address leaf for `127.0.0.1`, and the normal `--tls` probe authenticated
  Main plus independently attached Display 2/0, Cursor 4/0, and Inputs 3/0
  channels. The test CA was then deleted by its exact SHA-1 fingerprint;
  keychain lookup returned not-found and the leaf returned
  `CSSMERR_TP_NOT_TRUSTED`, confirming that no temporary trust remains.
- QEMU's 256,000-byte bandwidth-probe PING padding exposed and closed a decoder
  interoperability bug; PING now decodes its fixed prefix while other generated
  messages retain strict trailing-byte rejection.
- A minimal Alpine initramfs booted under nested KVM with Apple's custom arm64
  kernel, virtio-gpu framebuffer, virtio keyboard, and virtio mouse. The guest
  reached a 1280x800 framebuffer and continuously changed its tty0 contents.
- Live Display initially stalled because the client omitted
  `SPICE_MSGC_DISPLAY_INIT`. The generated 14-byte client message and Display
  bootstrap are now implemented and covered by a wire test. A subsequent live
  probe received one monitor configuration and 135 immutable 1280x800 frames.
- The same probe received a Cursor initialization, keyboard modifier state, and
  two mouse-motion acknowledgements. The guest's raw input device recorded the
  injected A-key transition as EV_KEY code 30, proving the Inputs path reached
  the booted guest rather than ending at the SPICE server.
- `Integration/AppleContainer` now retains the QEMU/SPICE Containerfile, pinned
  Alpine 3.22.5 initramfs recipe, guest init, lifecycle cleanup, live probe, and
  guest-side scan-code assertion. The Alpine source archive is verified against
  SHA-256 `3fbc6285032ed46821b511292633d7b2a6306a2e254f590e92bdafff56cf2f70`;
  generated artifacts remain ignored. The custom Apple containerization 0.40.1
  / Linux 6.18.5 KVM kernel remains an explicit external input because it is a
  29 MB locally built artifact.
- A clean initramfs regenerated by that recipe passed the strict harness with
  ticket authentication, two Display/Cursor channels, two monitor
  configurations, 57 immutable frames including the live 1280x800 framebuffer,
  keyboard-modifier state, two mouse-motion acknowledgements, and a guest raw
  `EV_KEY` code-30 value-1 record.
- A richer pinned Alpine 3.22 Agent initramfs now adds Xorg 21.1.19,
  spice-vdagent 0.22.1, xrandr, and xclip. One combined live run closed exact
  30-byte host-to-guest file transfer, 26-byte host-to-guest and 27-byte
  guest-to-host UTF-8 clipboard payloads, two Display heads, Inputs delivery,
  and an applied 1440x600 XRandR layout composed from 800x600 and 640x480
  outputs.
- Linux spice-vdagent advertises clipboard-by-demand without the obsolete
  legacy clipboard bit. Clipboard readiness now follows that interoperable
  capability shape and has a focused regression test.
- For virtio-gpu, spice-server intercepts `VD_AGENT_MONITORS_CONFIG` and calls
  QEMU's `client_monitors_config` UI-info path instead of forwarding the packet
  to guest vdagent; an Agent reply is therefore absent by design. QEMU trace
  recorded head 1 as 640x480 and head 0 as 800x600, connector hotplug reached
  Xorg, and the bare guest's explicit auto-layout policy applied both outputs.
  Display Channel messages then reported both heads and produced frames.
- The topology change also showed that spice-server may re-emit Cursor Init on
  an existing Cursor Channel. Cursor Init is now an authoritative state/cache
  reset, with a regression test, rather than a false protocol failure.

## Stage B external TLS gate closure

- Both trust directions are now closed: a temporarily system-trusted local chain
  completes normal `--tls` Main and child-channel attachment, while the same
  self-managed chain fails after trust removal. Terminal certificate/trust
  `.waiting` errors propagate as TLS failures, while a genuinely stalled
  handshake remains covered by the bounded negative-timeout listener test.

## Stage C delivered so far

- Generated and dispatched Display Surface Create (314) and Destroy (315).
- Bounded actor-isolated SurfaceStore for 32-bit xRGB and ARGB surfaces.
- RAW 32-bit bitmap draw-copy with top-down and bottom-up row orientation.
- Solid fill and overlap-safe COPY_BITS execution primitives.
- Immutable frame snapshots for the later presentation/coalescing boundary.
- Bounds, stride, allocation-limit, duplicate-surface, and malformed-input tests.
- Source-validated wire models for DisplayBase, signed Rect/Point, inline Clip
  rectangles, Brush, QMask, Image descriptors, RAW Bitmap, and Surface images.
- Strict decoding for COPY_BITS (104), DRAW_FILL (302), and DRAW_COPY (304),
  including relative image offsets and bounded pointer payload validation.
- DisplayChannel dispatch into SurfaceStore with bounded canonical clip regions,
  solid PUT fills, one-to-one RAW/surface DRAW_COPY, COPY_BITS, Ping/Pong, and
  ACK handling. `PixelRegion` computes `destination ∩ surfaceBounds ∩
  union(clips)` as ordered y bands with sorted disjoint x intervals. Nil/single
  clips stay inline; multi-clip normalization uses compressed x coordinates, a
  y sweep, and a lazy range-add coverage tree. Input is capped at 4,096 clips
  and output at 65,536 segments before Surface mutation. Each non-empty wire
  fill or copy validates the complete region and commits one Surface revision,
  mutation generation, and transaction; empty or failed regions commit none.
  Same-Surface copy then uses quadrant-safe segment order and direction-aware
  row `memmove`; cross-Surface copy reads directly from its synchronized source.
  No Surface copy allocates area-sized staging, contiguous non-overlapping
  rectangles use one bulk call, and fill segments use the arm64 NEON kernel.
- A complete Mini-header transcript test from Surface Create through real draw
  wire bodies to the expected framebuffer and Surface Destroy.
- An external JSON golden-frame fixture that replays Surface Create, DRAW_FILL,
  RAW DRAW_COPY, and COPY_BITS and verifies the exact BGRA framebuffer.
- Generated Inputs client/server messages plus an actor-isolated Inputs channel
  for physical PC scan-code transitions, lock modifiers, relative/absolute
  pointer motion, button masks, and server motion acknowledgements.
- Strict Cursor Init/Reset/Set/Move/Hide/Trail and cache-invalidation decoding,
  with bounded cursor-shape caching and actor-isolated visible cursor state.
- Session channel dispatch now constructs Display, Inputs, and Cursor actors;
  unsupported channel types remain passive authenticated connections.
- Session now supervises Main, Display, Inputs, and Cursor receive loops after
  bootstrap. A channel failure cancels its peers, closes every connection,
  clears credentials, and publishes a typed failure event.
- The public Session event stream is reserved for ordered control state:
  display configuration, keyboard modifiers, mouse-motion acknowledgements,
  migration, failure, and disconnect. Frame, surface-lifecycle, cursor, and
  pointer-mode state use the stable `SpiceDesktopSource` instead of the event
  mailbox or SwiftUI Observation.
- Display commands always advance the canonical Surface and its damage journal.
  A visible desktop subscription enables snapshot preparation; hidden,
  occluded, detached, or zero-size views suppress snapshots without pausing
  protocol drawing. Each Surface keeps at most one prepared frame and one
  latest pending revision. Consumption unlocks the next preparation, while a
  lifecycle change, damage-history gap, or visibility resume forces full
  damage. Exact lifecycle/revision matching suppresses stale snapshots.
- `SpiceDesktopView` is a thin `NSViewRepresentable` around one private AppKit
  framebuffer view. It owns a normally paused `NSView` display link and an
  explicit-draw `MTKView`; the ready latch selects at most the newest desktop
  revision per display tick. It also handles first-responder state, physical
  macOS-keycode to PC-XT mapping, relative or absolute pointer input, buttons,
  and scroll-wheel events.

Inputs transports physical key transitions, not Unicode text or IME
composition. The AppKit bridge uses `NSCursor` for supported absolute alpha
cursors and a cached Core Animation overlay for captured relative cursors, so a
cursor-only update does not redraw the framebuffer. Other cursor pixel formats
remain pending; color8 and color24 payloads are explicitly rejected until their
palette/pixel formats are implemented.

## Deferred Stage C enhancements

- Add scaled DRAW_COPY, pattern brushes, masks, and additional ROP operations.
- Add a sample SwiftUI application scene and observable connection model on top
  of the library-level bridge.
- Add native host-cursor replacement and remaining decoded cursor format
  conversion.
- Add focus/capture policy, mouse-motion ACK backpressure, and richer keyboard
  edge recovery around the AppKit input bridge.

## Stage D delivered so far

- Added the independent `SpiceCodecs` target with a Sendable async decoder
  interface, typed codec errors, immutable BGRA output, and explicit encoded,
  decoded, and dimension limits.
- Added strict Display wire decoding for `SPICE_IMAGE_TYPE_JPEG` (105), including
  bounded `data_size` handling and truncated-payload rejection.
- Added a TurboJPEG decoder using `@concurrent`; socket parsing and Surface
  mutation remain serialized in DisplayChannel while CPU decode runs outside
  its inherited actor executor.
- Added a `CTurboJPEG` SwiftPM binary target backed by the package's arm64
  static XCFramework. All C handles and unsafe buffer access are isolated in
  the `SpiceCodecInterop` target.
- TurboJPEG validates the JPEG header dimensions before writing into a bounded,
  preallocated destination and treats decoder warnings as failures. RGB-family
  inputs decode directly to BGRA; CMYK/YCCK inputs use TurboJPEG's required
  four-component output followed by a bounded, rounded CMYK-to-BGRA conversion.
- DisplayChannel accepts an injected JPEG decoder and commits decoded pixels to
  SurfaceStore only after full decode and validation. A failed decode leaves the
  destination Surface byte-for-byte unchanged.
- Added checked-in JPEG plus RGB goldens generated by libjpeg-turbo 3.2.0,
  along with bounds, truncated-corpus, ICC-marker, and warning-path tests.

The TurboJPEG backend is byte-for-byte identical to six checked-in
libjpeg-turbo 3.2.0 goldens covering baseline 4:4:4, grayscale, 4:2:0,
progressive encoding, odd dimensions, CMYK, and an ICC-profile-bearing image.
The ICC case verifies transport and decoding of the profile-bearing JPEG; the
decoder does not currently perform ICC color management. Removing the terminal
EOI from a valid JPEG exercises libjpeg-turbo's warning path, and both the codec
boundary and a real DisplayChannel integration test confirm rejection without
Surface mutation. The local Stage D JPEG acceptance gate is closed.

The TurboJPEG portion is statically linked from the checked-in, reproducible
native dependency artifact.

### LZ RGB-family slice

- Added strict Display wire support for `SPICE_IMAGE_TYPE_LZ_RGB` (101) using
  the protocol's bounded BinaryData payload.
- Added a Swift 6 SPICE LZ 1.1 decoder for RGB16, RGB24, RGB32, RGBA, XXXA,
  and A8 streams. It validates the big-endian
  magic/version/type/dimensions/stride/top-down header, writes each plane
  directly into one preallocated `Data` backing, validates every
  literal/back-reference, and rejects truncation and trailing bytes.
- Overlapping color references copy one initialized period and then double it
  with bounded bulk copies. Alpha references use the existing strided overlap
  kernel in one Swift-to-C call. Per-decode diagnostics record output backing,
  temporary decoded storage, reference calls, and copied bytes without global
  mutable state.
- Added independent fixtures for all six supported formats, generated offline
  by the fixed `spice-common` C `lz.c` encoder/decoder. Swift output matches all
  reference BGRA bytes exactly, including overlapping back-reference behavior.
- Codec output now records whether alpha is meaningful. Display and
  SurfaceStore preserve it only for an ARGB source copied into an ARGB Surface;
  xRGB destinations remain opaque.
- LZ DRAW_COPY follows the same transactional boundary as JPEG: only a fully
  decoded immutable image reaches SurfaceStore.

The LZ RGB family is locally closed.

### LZ palette slice

`SPICE_IMAGE_TYPE_LZ_PLT` and its palette path are also locally closed:

- Added strict `SPICE_IMAGE_TYPE_LZ_PLT` parsing for canonical inline-palette
  pointers and cached palette IDs, with bounded entry and compressed-data sizes.
- Added PLT1 LE/BE, PLT4 LE/BE, and PLT8 expansion. Five independent
  `spice-common` fixtures match visible BGRA pixels byte-for-byte, including
  packed-row padding.
- Palette LZ first decodes exact packed bytes into the prefix of the final BGRA
  `Data`, then walks rows and packed columns backwards to expand in place from
  a precomputed byte-to-BGRA lookup table. The reverse walk preserves packed
  cross-row references and partial row tails without a second decoded backing;
  diagnostics distinguish lookup expansions and visible pixels.
- DisplayChannel uses a bounded palette cache, commits `PAL_CACHE_ME` only after
  successful decode/render, resolves `PAL_FROM_CACHE`, and handles palette 107,
  palette-all 108, and Display RESET 103 invalidation.
- Missing palettes, malformed streams, invalid indices, bad pointers, and every
  truncated fixture fail without changing the Surface or populating the cache.

### QUIC exact slice

- Added strict `SPICE_IMAGE_TYPE_QUIC` BinaryData parsing and a bounded async
  decoder for GRAY, RGB16, RGB24, RGB32, and RGBA.
- The exact backend uses the `spice-common` QUIC implementation supplied by the
  package from `spice-gtk` 0.42. A C-only shim copies input to aligned words, catches the
  backend's non-returning error callback with `setjmp`/`longjmp`, rejects
  warnings, and writes only into a preallocated BGRA buffer. Swift never holds
  a QUIC context or C pointer.
- Five independent 7x5 fixtures generated by the same C encoder/decoder match
  byte-for-byte. Every truncated byte prefix and a mutated magic corpus return
  typed errors without crashing.
- Display preserves QUIC's bottom-up row order and RGBA alpha semantics. A
  failed decode leaves the destination Surface unchanged.

### Image cache slice

- Corrected the source-backed image type values to `SURFACE` 104 and `JPEG`
  105; `FROM_CACHE` 103 and `FROM_CACHE_LOSSLESS` 106 are now descriptor-only
  image references.
- One Session-owned `DisplayImageCache` actor now serves every Display channel;
  palette caches remain Display-local. RAW, JPEG, LZ palette/RGB, and QUIC
  sources are decoded once per command, even when several clip rectangles are
  present. Standalone package-level Display channels own and close their private
  fallback cache, while one channel cannot close an injected Session cache.
- `CACHE_ME` and `CACHE_REPLACE_ME` register a noncopyable mutation before
  asynchronous source resolution or decode, stage the decoded bitmap afterward,
  and consume it through commit or abort around the Surface transaction. This
  makes invalidation during decode visible before late cache publication while
  preserving the rule that commit cannot throw after Surface success. Same-ID
  mutations acquire their active slot through a bounded, cancellation-safe FIFO
  rather than failing merely because another Display is decoding the same ID.
  When the command is a logical submessage, its retained-byte charge is the
  complete physical batch body backing the shared `Data` slice, not merely the
  logical body length.
  Outcome counters distinguish committed, concurrently invalidated, and
  teardown-discarded mutations.
- `CACHE_REPLACE_ME` accepts only a lossless source replacing a committed lossy
  representation. `FROM_CACHE_LOSSLESS` suspends across Display channels until
  that replacement commits. Missing references likewise resolve asynchronously;
  waits are cancellation-safe, limited to 64, and may retain no more than one
  cache byte budget in aggregate. Clear and Session close resume every waiter
  exactly once.
- Repeated `CACHE_ME` and targeted invalidation retain compatible reference-count
  semantics. Invalidation marks all currently active and queued bounded
  mutations, so earlier work cannot resurrect invalidated state and fresh or
  nonexistent IDs leave no retained tombstones. Active/queued counts,
  mutation-retained message bytes, staged bitmap bytes, and resolver-retained
  bytes all have hard limits. Cancellation, clear, and Session close resume and
  release queued work exactly once. Dimension disagreement, invalid flags,
  decode failure, and capacity overflow fail without publishing cache state.
- Display `INVAL_LIST` 105 invalidates the Session entry for every Display.
  `INVAL_ALL_PIXMAPS` 106 first observes the AIP-11 processed-serial requirements,
  then clears the Session cache. RESET 103 preserves that image cache while
  clearing the Display-local palette cache. Seamless and semi-seamless rebinding
  retain the source cache; full replacement and disconnect close it.

### GLZ RGB and dictionary slice

- Added strict `SPICE_IMAGE_TYPE_GLZ_RGB` (102) BinaryData parsing and Display
  execution for RGB16, RGB24, RGB32, and RGBA streams.
- The pure-Swift decoder validates the 33-byte big-endian GLZ header, dimensions,
  stride, image IDs, window-head distance, every literal, same-image reference,
  cross-image reference, and exact stream consumption before publishing output.
- The GLZ dictionary is an actor shared by all Display channels in one Session.
  It supports out-of-order IDs, contiguous tail-gap closure, protocol-directed
  window eviction, image/byte limits, and atomic commit only after full decode.
- A four-image literal/cross-image RGB32/RGBA sequence was checked against the
  exported spice-common decoder from spice-gtk 0.42.3 and is stored as an
  offline golden fixture. RGB16/RGB24 and malformed/truncated cases have focused
  coverage; failed input leaves the dictionary unchanged.
- Multi-Display out-of-order references now suspend on the shared actor until
  the referenced image commits, matching spice-gtk's coroutine wait semantics.
  Wait count and retained decoded bytes are bounded; cancellation, dictionary
  clear, and already-evicted references terminate without leaking continuations.
- The expanded corpus covers 8,192- and 131,073-pixel same-image offsets
  (including the bit-17 very-long form), image distances 300 and 70,000
  (including two extension bytes), out-of-order gap closure, repeated
  window-head rollover, retained-edge references, and rejected references
  immediately beyond the advertised history. All four extreme offset/distance
  streams match spice-common output.
- A reverse-started 20-image dependency chain exercises suspended cross-image
  decode, actor reentrancy, ordered commit, and repeated dictionary eviction.
  Every dependent resolves to the source pixels, the retained window edge stays
  readable, and the immediately evicted history fails without another wait.
- Full and Mini header paths publish explicit or implicit server serials to a
  session-wide cancellation-safe barrier only after the complete physical
  message has been processed. `INVAL_ALL_PIXMAPS` therefore waits through
  related handler work before invalidating the Session-scoped image cache.

### ZLIB GLZ slice

- Added strict `SPICE_IMAGE_TYPE_ZLIB_GLZ_RGB` (107) parsing for separate
  compressed `data_size` and exact uncompressed `glz_data_size` bounds.
- A small CZlib shim owns `z_stream` and requires `Z_STREAM_END`, exact output
  length, and full compressed-input consumption. Swift allocates only the
  prevalidated declared output size; oversized expansion requests are rejected
  before allocation.
- Inflated bytes feed the same Session-shared GLZ actor, so wrapped and
  unwrapped images share cross-image dictionary references and eviction state.
- The checked-in zlib/GLZ fixture matches spice-gtk 0.42.3's exported zlib and
  GLZ decoders. Every compressed prefix, trailing input, incorrect declared
  size, invalid zlib data, and over-limit expansion fail without changing the
  Surface or GLZ dictionary.

### MJPEG stream lifecycle slice

- Added strict current-wire decoding for Stream Create 122, Data 123, Clip 124,
  Destroy 125, Destroy All 126, and Data Sized 316. Stream IDs are restricted to
  the protocol's `[0, 64)` range; flags, codec enums, dimensions, clip counts,
  payload lengths, truncation, and trailing bytes are validated before state is
  changed.
- Display Link advertises `SIZED_STREAM`, `MULTI_CODEC`, and `CODEC_MJPEG`.
  H.264 or H.265 is added only by the corresponding explicit endpoint policy;
  the two advanced codecs are mutually exclusive. VP8, VP9, and stream
  reporting remain unadvertised.
- DisplayChannel owns at most 64 active stream records. Duplicate creation,
  unknown data/clip/destroy, capacity overflow, unsupported codecs, and invalid
  Surface destinations are typed protocol failures. RESET, Surface Destroy,
  explicit Destroy, and Destroy All release the relevant state.
- Each MJPEG stream owns one persistent TurboJPEG handle and at most three
  IOSurface-backed BGRA buffers. Stream decoding enables fast DCT/upsampling and
  writes directly into a locked buffer; standalone JPEG continues through the
  bit-exact decoder. A session-wide limiter permits at most two concurrent
  MJPEG decodes, and pool pressure takes a bounded Data fallback without
  waiting. Normal frames use create-time geometry; sized frames carry their own
  dimensions and destination. TOP_DOWN and bottom-up streams follow
  spice-common's row semantics.
- The Metal compositor performs BGRA-to-BGRA nearest scaling and clip writes
  directly into a candidate Surface. The existing actor-isolated Data path is
  the nonblocking fallback. A malformed JPEG, invalid bitmap, bad geometry, or
  capacity failure leaves the previous Surface unchanged. Empty clips advance
  stream order without publishing a redundant frame.
- A session-wide multimedia clock is anchored from `MAIN_INIT.multimedia_time`
  against `ContinuousClock` and reset by strict Main message 106 decoding.
  Display channels share that clock. Timestamp comparison uses wrapping UInt32
  subtraction interpreted as Int32, so ordinary counter wraparound preserves
  early/late ordering.
- Frames are sequence-guarded across async decode. Due frames present
  immediately, future frames decode and then wait until their multimedia
  timestamp, and already-late MJPEG frames are dropped before TurboJPEG work.
  A frame that becomes late during decode/wait is also dropped before Surface
  mutation. Main clock resets are observed by active waits when they resume.
- Audio-driven latency correction remains part of Stage E Playback integration;
  this slice establishes the shared clock and video scheduling boundary only.
- Focused lifecycle coverage includes clip changes that affect only subsequent
  frames, 2x2 to 4x4 scaling, Data Sized overrides, bottom-up partial sources,
  failed-decode recovery, stream capacity, Destroy, and Destroy All.

Development and release products now statically link the checked-in arm64
artifacts for libjpeg-turbo, spice-common QUIC, usbredir, and libusb. The QUIC
slice no longer pulls in spice-gtk or GLib. `Scripts/verify-native-closure.sh`
rejects Homebrew, local build-tree, and other non-relocatable load paths.

## Stage D local closure

JPEG, LZ, QUIC, the Session image cache, GLZ/dictionary, ZLIB GLZ, and MJPEG
stream scheduling satisfy their local Stage D gates: exact reference output,
bounded malformed-input handling, transactional cache publication, and bounded
cross-Display resolve/invalidation semantics. Multi-Display cache lifecycle is
covered across seamless, semi-seamless, switch-host, and disconnect paths.

Live multi-Display/video interoperability remains part of the deferred QEMU
acceptance gate rather than evidence supplied by the local corpus.

## Stage E local closure

### Playback protocol and synchronization boundary

- Playback Link advertises only the implemented `VOLUME` and `LATENCY`
  capabilities. CELT 0.5.1 and Opus remain unadvertised and are rejected if a
  server sends them anyway.
- Added strict bounded wire decoding for DATA 101, MODE 102, START 103, STOP
  104, VOLUME 105, MUTE 106, and LATENCY 107. Packet payloads are capped at
  256 KiB; mode data, enums, channel counts, truncation, and trailing bytes are
  validated before channel state changes.
- The live QEMU gate exposed two schema mistakes hidden by the original local
  fixtures. Current spice-common defines `audio_data_mode` as `enum16`, and
  Playback START includes a trailing `uint32 time`; the decoder and Record MODE
  encoder now match that upstream wire layout, with exact-body regressions.
- PlaybackChannel implements the protocol ordering rules: supported MODE before
  START, DATA only while active, and STOP only from the active state. The local
  slice supports RAW signed 16-bit little-endian PCM from 8 to 192 kHz and at most
  eight channels. PCM packets must align to complete interleaved sample frames.
- `SpiceSession.playbackEvents` is a dedicated 32-entry newest-first bounded
  stream, separate from UI/session events, so slow audio consumption cannot
  create unbounded memory or duplicate PCM into the display event queue.
- `PLAYBACK_LATENCY` is surfaced as the server's minimum-buffer hint. It is not
  treated as measured device delay. A host sink reports its actual queued delay
  through `reportPlaybackDelay(milliseconds:)`; PlaybackChannel then anchors the
  shared multimedia clock to `last_packet_time - actual_delay`, matching the
  SPICE audio/video synchronization model.

### Bounded AVAudioEngine playback sink

- `SpiceAudioPlaybackSink` consumes the dedicated Playback stream and schedules
  interleaved RAW S16LE buffers on `AVAudioPlayerNode`. The source format is
  connected through `AVAudioEngine.mainMixerNode`, leaving conversion to the
  current output-device format to the engine.
- Queue state is bounded by a configurable duration (500 ms by default). It
  honors the server minimum-latency hint as the startup waterline, drops a
  packet that alone exceeds the whole budget, and on aggregate overflow flushes
  older scheduled audio in favor of the newest packet. Generation tags make
  callbacks from flushed buffers harmless.
- A drained player is stopped so its sample timeline is reset; the next packet
  rebuilds the configured startup buffer and restarts playback. Sink events
  expose starts, stops, overflows, oversized drops, underruns, and engine errors.
- Every 50 ms by default, the sink derives remaining frames from
  `AVAudioPlayerNode.playerTime` (falling back to queued frames before rendering)
  and reports that measured queue delay through `SpiceSession`. Mute and SPICE
  volume are applied at the player node; the current single-node backend uses
  the average for a multi-channel volume vector rather than a per-channel gain
  matrix.
- `SpiceAudioPlaybackSink.statistics()` exposes monotonic scheduled packet and
  frame counts for non-GUI acceptance without copying PCM into a second stream
  consumer.

The bounded queue, stale-callback rejection, underrun recovery, delay math, and
exact PCM buffer population are covered deterministically. Playback is also
live-closed through the independent Rocky x86_64 audio fixture: QEMU 8.2.2 and
spice-server 0.15.1 exposed an ICH9 HDA duplex device, the guest generated an
880 Hz S16LE stream, and SwiftSpice observed RAW 48 kHz stereo START,
`mute=false`, then scheduled a 480-frame packet in AVAudioEngine. Evidence is in
the remote run `audio-live/logs/20260801T025001Z`. Human-audible output and
device route changes still require operator/hardware acceptance.

### Record protocol and bounded AVAudioEngine capture source

- Record Channel strictly decodes server START 101, STOP 102, VOLUME 103, and
  MUTE 104. RAW S16LE streams are limited to 1 to 8 channels and 8 to 192 kHz;
  duplicate START, STOP while inactive, DATA while inactive, and incomplete
  interleaved PCM frames fail the channel.
- Client capture traffic enforces the protocol sequence RAW MODE 102,
  START_MARK 103, then timestamped DATA 101. Mode/start marking is tied to a
  server-started stream and cannot be repeated or bypassed.
- `SpiceSession.recordEvents` is a dedicated 32-entry oldest-first control
  stream. Overflow is fatal instead of silently losing START/STOP state, while
  PCM travels directly from the capture sender to RecordChannel and is capped
  at 256 KiB per packet.
- `SpiceAudioCaptureSource` installs a tap only for an active server-requested
  stream, converts the default macOS input format to the requested interleaved
  S16LE format, and hands packets to async transport through a mutex-protected
  duration-bounded queue (500 ms by default). Aggregate overflow discards the
  oldest packets to bound latency and reports the dropped duration.
- Core Audio callbacks do not create one Task per buffer. A newest-one signal
  wakes one async drain, so callback rate cannot create unbounded task or PCM
  accumulation. Conversion failures and channel failures stop the active tap
  and are published through source events.
- Record volume/mute messages are decoded and surfaced, but their capability is
  not advertised and software input gain is not yet applied. CELT/Opus are also
  unadvertised. An embedding app must provide `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`,
  user-visible capture state, and consent handling.

Wire/state/queue behavior is covered locally. The client-to-guest Record wire is
also live-closed with a deterministic non-microphone source: SwiftSpice received
RAW 48 kHz stereo START, sent 144,000 frames using 16-bit MODE/START_MARK/DATA,
and the Alpine guest completed a 2,880,000-byte `arecord` artifact with SHA-256
`312d8ac05afe6a46da9aac84169a3d022ceca4e9dacd7280f2c1cecc7306b4e5`.
That differs from an all-zero artifact of the same size. Evidence is in remote
run `audio-live/logs/20260801T025212Z`. Actual microphone permission and input
route conversion remain `pending_hardware`; the synthetic gate does not claim
physical microphone coverage.

### Main/Agent transport and UTF-8 clipboard

- Main Link now advertises only `SPICE_MAIN_CAP_AGENT_CONNECTED_TOKENS` from the
  implemented Main capability set. Main Init and both connected notification
  variants seed explicit Agent connection/token state; duplicate or
  out-of-order connect, disconnect, token, and data messages fail the channel.
- `AGENT_START` is the first client Agent message and grants the server an
  eight-packet receive window. Every accepted server packet consumes and then
  replenishes one token. Client sends are preflighted against their complete
  fragment count, so insufficient tokens cannot produce a partial logical
  message.
- Added bounded VDAgent stream framing: 20-byte little-endian headers, 2048-byte
  SPICE packet fragments, 16 MiB logical-data ceiling, headers/payloads split at
  arbitrary packet boundaries, multiple logical messages per packet, and
  preservation of unknown protocol/type values. Bootstrap queues at most 64
  Agent events and 16 MiB of Agent payload before Channels List arrives.
- `SpiceSession.agentEvents` is a dedicated 64-entry oldest-first stream. Agent
  control/data events never share the frame-coalescing path; if its bounded
  consumer queue fills, the session fails instead of silently losing clipboard
  protocol state.
- The framing work uncovered and fixed `ByteReader` bulk reads against a
  non-zero-index `Data` slice. A regression test now covers that path.
- VDAgent capability negotiation advertises clipboard, clipboard-by-demand,
  monitor integration, and file-transfer detailed-error decoding. The state
  machine implements symmetric UTF-8
  GRAB/REQUEST/DATA/RELEASE ownership, rejects unsolicited or invalid UTF-8
  payloads, bounds text to the 16 MiB Agent envelope minus its four-byte type,
  suppresses pasteboard echo, and reoffers unchanged local text after reconnect.
- `SpiceAgentManager` consumes the dedicated Agent event stream, retries an
  announcement held back by exhausted client tokens, polls the general macOS
  pasteboard at a configurable 250 ms default, and provides `publish(_:)` for an
  immediate path. All `NSPasteboard` access is isolated in a small `@MainActor`
  bridge, and pasteboard write refusal is surfaced as a failure event.
- Main Init's initial Agent-connected state is now published into
  `SpiceSession.agentEvents`, so a manager started immediately after `connect`
  does not depend on a later connected notification.
- Dynamic resolution now encodes the exact single-monitor
  `VD_AGENT_MONITORS_CONFIG` layout (height precedes width on wire), advertises
  MONITORS_CONFIG and REPLY without claiming sparse/position support, and
  strictly decodes the matching `VD_AGENT_REPLY`. Legacy peers retain the
  protocol-defined baseline monitor/reply capabilities until they explicitly
  announce otherwise.
- `requestResolution(width:height:)` validates UInt32 dimensions, serializes
  requests behind Agent tokens, keeps only the newest resize while a reply is
  pending, and requeues the active request across Agent reconnect. Its event
  stream distinguishes queued, sent, acknowledged, rejected, unsupported, and
  transport/protocol failures.
- Multi-monitor requests now use explicit IDs and signed positions. The Agent
  manager validates unique IDs and wire ranges, inserts 0x0 placeholders for
  missing/disabled IDs only when sparse configuration is negotiated, and sets
  USE_POS only when the peer advertises monitor-position support. Continuous
  layout changes still coalesce to the latest complete configuration.
- Display Link advertises `SPICE_DISPLAY_CAP_MONITORS_CONFIG`. Message 317 is
  decoded as the authoritative `count/max_allowed/QXLHead[]` result with a
  256-head bound, exact body sizing, unique IDs, nonzero geometry, and checked
  coordinate extents. Empty notifications are acknowledged but do not replace
  the last useful layout.
- `SpiceSessionEvent.displayConfiguration` publishes the actual guest monitors,
  surface IDs, positions, dimensions, flags, maximum supported heads, and the
  originating Display Channel ID. This preserves the Linux multi-head/single-
  channel versus Windows multi-device/channel distinction.

### Bounded, explicitly authorized file transfer

- Added strict codecs for `VD_AGENT_FILE_XFER_START`, `STATUS`, and `DATA`,
  including all status values plus packed GLib-I/O and free-space details.
  Metadata contains only a validated basename and UInt64 byte size; separators,
  control characters, dot paths, leading/trailing whitespace, oversized names,
  and inconsistent chunk lengths are rejected.
- `SpiceAgentManager.sendFile(at:name:)` is the sole initiation path. It accepts
  one regular file selected by the application, never scans directories or
  reacts to clipboard/drag state automatically, and waits for an explicit peer
  capability announcement that does not contain `FILE_XFER_DISABLED`.
- A transfer sends START, waits for `CAN_SEND_DATA`, reads at most one bounded
  chunk off the manager actor, then sends DATA. Chunks are capped at 16,000
  bytes so a complete Agent message fits the common eight-token window; token
  exhaustion sends no partial message and is retried by the existing Agent
  work loop.
- At most four transfers and one pending chunk per transfer are retained by
  default. Source size defaults to an 8 GiB policy ceiling. A file truncated or
  made unreadable during transfer produces a client ERROR status rather than
  leaving a guest transfer ID hanging.
- Completion requires a guest SUCCESS after all declared bytes are sent.
  Application cancellation before START is purely local; after START it sends
  CANCELLED. Disconnect fails active transfers. Detailed status, progress, and
  terminal results use a dedicated bounded `fileTransferEvents` stream.
- Standard VDAgent file transfer is host-to-guest. Unsolicited guest START/DATA
  is rejected as a protocol error; this implementation never derives or writes
  a host path from guest data. Security-scoped URL acquisition and release stay
  under embedding-application control.

Clipboard integration remains UTF-8 text only. Images, clipboard
selection/serial extensions, and a committed-text paste-keystroke workflow are
not implemented. File transfer is a separate explicit host-to-guest path.
Inputs remains physical PC scan-code transport; VDAgent UTF-8 clipboard is a
separate data path and is not guest IME composition synchronization. Automatic
general-pasteboard synchronization is privacy-sensitive and must be exposed as
such by an embedding application.

## Stage F advanced-video groundwork

- Added a bounded Annex-B parser for H.264 and H.265. It accepts three- and
  four-byte start codes, validates forbidden/header fields, caps encoded bytes,
  NAL size, and NAL count, and rejects empty/trailing units.
- AVC SPS/PPS/SPS-extension and HEVC VPS/SPS/PPS are separated from picture
  data. Remaining units are converted to CoreMedia's four-byte big-endian
  length-prefixed sample representation. Picture and random-access NALs are
  classified without parsing unbounded Exp-Golomb payloads.
- Added the isolated `SpiceVideoToolbox` target. Its actor accumulates parameter
  sets, creates the matching CoreMedia format description, and owns a
  synchronous, ordered `VTDecompressionSession`. It requests real-time,
  Metal-compatible, IOSurface-backed NV12 and emits a package-only frame that
  retains the immutable `CVPixelBuffer`. Every plane, stride, matrix, and range
  is bounded; `copyBGRA()` is a one-time lazy cached fallback. The decoder
  checks `UsingHardwareAcceleratedVideoDecoder` and rejects software or
  unqueryable sessions. Unsupported formats and unavailable hardware become
  typed codec failures. Parameter-set replacement creates and validates the new
  session before atomically swapping it with the old one; a failed creation
  remains marked for retry on the next frame.
- DisplayChannel now owns an advanced decoder per H.264/H.265 stream, routes
  decoded output first through the package-only native Metal compositor and
  then, when required, through the existing BGRA clip/scale transaction,
  and closes decoder sessions on stream/surface destruction, RESET, destroy-all,
  or channel close. Already-late inter-frame video is still submitted so codec
  reference state and in-band parameter sets advance, but its decoded image is
  intentionally not committed. Frame-local mapping/format errors fall back for
  that frame; pipeline or command-execution failure permanently disables Metal
  for the current stream generation. Every advanced CPU fallback is counted.
- Added reproducible FFmpeg 8.1.2 software reference fixtures for H.264 High,
  H.264 Baseline, and H.265 Main at 128x128. The Baseline stream changes SPS/PPS
  on an existing decoder and proves session replacement. Real VideoToolbox
  output matches independent FFmpeg software-decoded BGRA with exact geometry
  and alpha and a maximum RGB delta of four from YUV conversion rounding.
- The safe-default Display Link remains exactly `SIZED_STREAM`,
  `MONITORS_CONFIG`, `MULTI_CODEC`, and `CODEC_MJPEG` (`0x303`). An explicit
  endpoint policy may add either `CODEC_H264` (`0xb03`) or `CODEC_H265`
  (`0x4303`). The local encoded/decode backend corpus gate is closed for both
  codecs.
- A Rocky x86_64 live probe confirmed that Ubuntu's spice-server 0.15.1 accepts
  an H.264 preference and creates real `x264enc` streams. Its unconstrained
  `videoconvert`, however, negotiates Y444 and emits H.264 High 4:4:4, which
  macOS VideoToolbox rejects with status `-8969`. The experimental capability
  advertisement is therefore not the default. A separate guest stream-device
  probe then supplied deterministic 1280x720 yuv420p H.264 Constrained Baseline
  through the unmodified server. With explicit H.264 policy and the stream
  active, SwiftSpice published 360 aggregate Display frames in eight seconds
  without a decode/session failure; the server observed
  `h264=1 streaming=1`. The default-policy negative gate observed
  `h264=0 streaming=0`. The same fixture supplied deterministic 1280x720
  yuv420p H.265 Main. With explicit H.265 policy, SwiftSpice again published
  360 aggregate Display frames in eight seconds without a decode/session
  failure; the server observed `h265=1 selected=h265 streaming=1`. Its default
  negative gate observed `h264=0 h265=0 selected=none streaming=0`. The
  loopback-only reproduction fixture is under `Integration/RemoteRocky/Video`.
  These retained runs prove protocol advertisement and VideoToolbox decode;
  they predate, and therefore do not prove, the revisioned IOSurface/Metal
  composition path below.
- Added an isolated `SpiceIOSurface` ownership target and a default
  triple-buffer frame pool keyed by geometry and 32-bit BGRA pixel format.
  Allocation is bounded by frame count and bytes; idle mismatched entries may
  be evicted, while exhaustion by live readers immediately returns the existing
  immutable `Data` frame instead of blocking the Display receive loop.
- Each published frame holds an immutable IOSurface read lease. The pool cannot
  recycle that surface until the last copied/coalesced/presented frame releases
  it. `SpiceFrame` exposes IOSurface identity and geometry while preserving
  immutable packed-BGRA semantics and existing semantic equality; its `Data`
  readback is generated on first CPU access and then cached.
- Real IOSurface allocation, lock/copy/unlock, byte-exact readback, exhaustion
  fallback, and post-release reuse are covered by local tests.
- The current Apple Silicon backing is a per-Surface revision ring, enabled only
  when the device reports unified memory, Apple GPU family 7 or newer, and a
  real IOSurface texture probe succeeds. Every Surface has at most three slots,
  including retired slots still held by old frames, under one process-wide
  256 MiB IOSurface allocation budget shared with the legacy snapshot pool.
- A published canonical slot is immutable while any frame or GPU presentation
  lease is live. After all leases release, validated CPU-only damage may reuse
  it in place; native-video and other fallible GPU writes always use a distinct
  candidate. Lagging candidates catch up from bounded revision damage history
  with at most 64 losslessly coalesced rectangles. A cheap rectangle-area upper
  bound avoids unnecessary union work; exact sweep-line union coverage reaches
  the 50-percent threshold before the journal becomes a full upload.
  Three live consumer leases cause an immediate Data snapshot fallback rather
  than a Display wait; cached legacy slots are purged before pressure demotes
  the revisioned path. Resize, store close, and same-ID recreation retire slots
  without invalidating old frames. Store close first enters a terminal state,
  rejects new operations, drains every in-flight per-Surface tail, and lets
  concurrent close callers observe the same completed teardown.
- The session-wide CPU budget counts every live canonical Surface across all
  Display channels. A Data fallback snapshot makes an independent packed-BGRA
  copy at the publication boundary, so a caller retaining only `pixels` cannot
  participate in a later canonical Surface COW. Desktop backlog remains bounded
  by one prepared frame, one latest pending revision, and each subscriber's
  `bufferingNewest(1)` stream.
- `SpiceMetalCompositor` maps NV12 Y as `r8Unorm` and UV as `rg8Unorm`; one
  command encoder applies BT.601/709, video/full range, top/bottom orientation,
  nearest scaling, all clips, and writes the candidate IOSurface. The source
  pixel buffer and texture wrappers live through command completion, and a
  candidate becomes canonical only after successful completion. Unknown color
  matrices and odd NV12 geometry use the CPU reference path.
- `DisplayFramePublisher` uses metadata-only descriptors and exact
  lifecycle/revision snapshots. `SpiceFrame.pixels` preserves immutable
  packed-BGRA semantics through a shared one-time lazy cache; a normal Metal
  viewer does not materialize it.
- Aggregate diagnostics cover damage and copy bytes, CPU materialization, pool
  exhaustion and leases, GPU copies/errors, native/fallback video, publisher
  demand suppression/coalescing, desktop-source delivery, display-link wakeups,
  texture-cache behavior, GPU-busy skips, Metal presentation failures, MJPEG
  allocation/reuse, and actual VideoToolbox hardware selection. Bounded
  content-free histograms expose publisher and Metal commit/completion/presented
  timing without retaining individual samples or per-frame logs.
  `spice-probe --require-native-video` turns the zero-BGRA and zero-GPU-error
  expectations into a live gate. Fault-injection regressions prove failed VT
  session creation and unsupported formats become typed codec failures, while a
  Metal command error disables only the current stream generation before CPU
  fallback.
- The SwiftPM `CompileMetalShaders` build-tool plugin produces the resource
  `.metallib`; package consumers receive it through SwiftPM. The native artifact
  closure verifier requires exact arm64 static frameworks and rejects absolute
  build-machine or Homebrew paths.
- `SpiceDesktopView` keeps a narrow `NSViewRepresentable` and AppKit responder
  boundary. Its private framebuffer view owns a normally paused display link
  and explicit-draw `MTKView`. IOSurface-backed BGRA frames reuse up to three
  texture wrappers and are sampled directly by one full-screen-triangle pass;
  1:1/integer scaling is nearest and other scaling is linear. There is no MPS,
  blit-only presentation, depth/MSAA attachment, or intermediate texture.
  CPU-only frames continue through the AppKit/CGImage fallback.
- The command-buffer completion callback retains the source `SpiceFrame`, so an
  in-flight GPU read cannot race frame-pool recycling. At most two commands are
  in flight; a busy GPU skips the tick rather than blocking the main actor.
  `CAMetalDrawable` presented handlers record confirmed on-screen latency.
- IOSurface now chooses its aligned row stride rather than inheriting the packed
  CPU stride. Real Metal tests map IOSurfaces, exercise compositor writes and
  direct render-pipeline presentation, and verify byte-exact BGRA where the
  operation is required to be exact. CPU-only rejection and the complete
  existing suite are also covered.
- Added the `spice-viewer` SwiftPM GUI executable as a project-local debug and
  integration client, with terminal logging and native-closure verification
  scripts for its library dependencies.
- The validation host drives synthetic 640×360 BGRA SurfaceStore frames with an
  absolute-deadline 30 fps schedule. Window-level inspection confirmed animated
  Metal output, aspect-fit presentation, and a measured 29.3 fps submission
  rate. Unified logging confirmed one host-start event and one transition to
  `Metal IOSurface` without noisy per-frame logging.
- Promoted `spice-viewer` to a session-driven macOS viewer while retaining the
  synthetic mode as `Offline Validation`. `Remote Session` exposes validated
  host/port input, TCP, system-trust TLS, and explicitly unsafe test TLS, plus a
  non-persisted ticket password and connection/error state.
- The viewer owns one supervised control-event task and passes the stable
  session desktop source directly to `SpiceDesktopView`; frames, cursor, and
  pointer mode never become observed application properties. Input enters one
  bounded 256-event FIFO and one sequential sender task rather than creating a
  task per key or pointer event.
- Real-window inspection covered mode switching, the session form, immediate
  connection cancellation, local validation errors, and continued IOSurface
  Metal presentation near 30 fps. The endpoint/TLS mapping has focused tests;
  the complete local suite passed 194 tests in 45 suites at that slice.
- Added cancellable connection lifecycle hardening. Each attempt has a 10-second
  deadline, and optional reconnect makes at most five retries with bounded
  1/2/4/8/16-second backoff. Disconnect, mode changes, and window closure cancel
  both active establishment and backoff immediately.
- Fixed `NetworkSpiceTransport` establishment cancellation at the transport
  boundary. It now starts TCP/TLS with a non-suspending empty idempotent send,
  observes channel state, and terminates the wait through its AsyncStream when
  the caller task is cancelled; it does not attempt a second blocking graceful
  close on an unestablished channel.
- Endpoint profiles persist only normalized name, host, port, and TLS mode.
  Passwords remain transient within the active connection lifecycle and are
  absent from both profile JSON and unified logs.
- Added bounded unified telemetry in `Profiles`, `Navigation`, and `Session`
  categories. Live log inspection confirmed profile load, mode selection,
  connection attempts, timeout, retry scheduling, and user cancellation without
  endpoint or credential disclosure.
- The viewer now discovers Playback channel 0 after session bootstrap and only
  then attaches `SpiceAudioPlaybackSink`. Its connected status bar surfaces
  format/mute state plus bounded resynchronization, oversized-drop, underrun,
  and dropped-duration counters. Sink failures enter the same visible bounded
  state instead of being hidden in a detached task.
- Disconnect, retry, mode changes, and window closure cancel the playback event
  supervisor and stop the sink before releasing the session. A real disconnected
  app launch produced no Playback attachment log, confirming that AVAudioEngine
  is not initialized before a Playback channel exists. That slice's
  warnings-as-errors gate passed 199 tests in 47 suites.
- The viewer now treats Record availability and microphone consent as separate
  states. Discovering Record channel 0 exposes `Mic Off` but does not query
  permission or construct `SpiceAudioCaptureSource`; Enable Mic is the only path
  that requests access and attaches the source. Permission wait can be cancelled,
  and an independent request generation rejects late authorization results after
  cancellation, disconnect, retry, or mode changes.
- Record status exposes permission denial/restriction, server start/stop, format,
  mute, capture failure, overflow count, and dropped duration. Disconnection
  stops the source before releasing the session and resets to per-session opt-in.
  The staged app contains `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`; launch logs contain no
  permission request or Record attachment. That slice's warnings-as-errors gate
  passed 201 tests in 48 suites.
- The viewer now exposes Agent UTF-8 clipboard as a per-session explicit opt-in.
  Before opt-in it drains the bounded `agentEvents` stream so a long-running
  session cannot fail merely because Agent control traffic has no consumer, but
  the drain discards events and never calls `SpicePasteboardBridge`. Enabling
  clipboard waits for that drain to terminate before handing the single stream
  to `SpiceAgentManager`; disabling performs the inverse handoff.
- Clipboard status surfaces negotiation readiness, host/guest ownership using
  byte counts only, oversized local rejects, and failures. It never retains or
  logs clipboard text. The UI and diagnostics explicitly identify this as
  VDAgent UTF-8 data transfer rather than Inputs scan codes or guest IME state.
  Disconnect, retry, and mode changes stop the manager before the session. A
  staged-app launch emitted no Clipboard telemetry or manager attachment. That
  slice's warnings-as-errors gate passed 203 tests in 49 suites.
- Refactored the viewer to keep one shared `SpiceAgentManager` for Agent control,
  monitor, clipboard, and file-transfer work. Its pasteboard policy is now
  mutable and protocol-visible: disabled mode advertises monitor/reply/sparse-
  monitor/file-transfer detailed-error support without clipboard/by-demand,
  ignores stale guest clipboard commands, and gates `synchronizePasteboard()`
  and `publish(_:)` before the AppKit bridge. Enabling/disabling reannounces the
  matching capabilities without replacing the Agent event consumer.
- Added explicitly authorized host-to-guest file selection through one narrow
  `NSOpenPanel` bridge. The panel accepts one regular file; the manager opens it
  while its security-scoped access is active, then owns the bounded reader.
  Viewer state retains at most eight entries and exposes queued, guest approval,
  progress, completion, failure, and cancellation. File names are visible in
  the user's menu but logs contain only transfer IDs and byte counts.
- A file-transfer menu provides Send File and per-active-transfer cancellation.
  It is available independently of clipboard opt-in and never changes the
  pasteboard policy. The staged app builds and launches without implicit
  Clipboard or file-transfer telemetry. That slice's warnings-as-errors gate
  passed 206 tests in 50 suites.
- Added a dedicated monitor popover backed by the shared Agent manager. It
  groups monitor IDs, surfaces, positions, and dimensions by Display Channel ID,
  retains the last useful inventory across empty notifications, and exposes a
  validated single-monitor width/height request without enabling clipboard.
- Resolution lifecycle state distinguishes queued, sent, acknowledged,
  rejected, unsupported, failed, and applied. Agent acknowledgement never
  mutates the inventory; only a subsequent matching Display Channel notification
  marks the request applied. Focused state tests cover this authority boundary.
  The staged viewer builds and launches cleanly, and the current
  warnings-as-errors gate passed 209 tests in 51 suites.
- Added a complete multi-monitor draft editor with add/remove rows, explicit
  0...255 IDs, positive UInt32 dimensions, and signed Int32 positions. A new
  Agent support stream reports baseline versus explicit monitor, sparse-ID, and
  position capabilities; the editor gates submission locally while the manager
  retains its wire-level validation.
- A single Display Channel draft preserves its monitor IDs. Multiple Display
  Channels are flattened deterministically and assigned sequential request IDs
  with an explicit warning because channel-local IDs cannot be assumed to map
  losslessly to VDAgent request indexes. Multi-monitor requests are marked
  applied only after a matching authoritative inventory. The current
  warnings-as-errors gate passes 214 tests in 52 suites.
- Added strict Main migration decoding for BEGIN, BEGIN_SEAMLESS, CANCEL,
  SWITCH_HOST, END, and destination seamless ACK/NACK, plus exact client
  CONNECTED, CONNECT_ERROR, END, DST_DO_SEAMLESS, and CONNECTED_SEAMLESS reply
  encoding. Destination host and certificate-subject C strings are bounded to
  4096 bytes, require final NUL without embedded NUL, require valid UTF-8, and
  reject destinations with no usable port.
- Added a generation-tagged migration handoff coordinator. A newer BEGIN first
  cancels the old preparation, late completion is ignored, CANCEL releases both
  preparing and prepared targets, and END is a protocol violation until a target
  is ready. Public session events expose preparing, ready, cancelled, committing,
  switching, completed, and failed phases without logging destination details.
- The session owns and cancels the handoff task across replacement, disconnect,
  and receive failure. Connection bootstrap now produces a locally owned
  prepared session without mutating the active Main/child Channel set. Migration
  targets correctly reuse the source session ID and source Channel inventory;
  they do not wait for a second MAIN_INIT/CHANNELS_LIST. A target becomes ready
  only after every source child Channel is authenticated and constructed;
  preparation failure or cancellation closes only those target transports and
  leaves source supervision running.
- Semi-seamless END first writes client MIGRATE_END to the prepared target, then
  atomically replaces the Main/child Channel set and starts its supervision
  before closing the source set. A dual-session fixture proves that subsequent
  Main events and Inputs writes use the target while source Inputs stay closed.
  Separate fixtures prove failed and cancelled preparation rollback. Existing
  TLS sessions cannot be downgraded to a plaintext migration port, and an
  unverified certificate subject is rejected. A target-only Main Link advertises
  the requested migration capabilities; when the target server confirms seamless
  support, the client sends DST_DO_SEAMLESS with the exact source version and
  strictly accepts only ACK/NACK before reporting CONNECTED_SEAMLESS or falling
  back to CONNECTED. Ordinary source Main Links now advertise both semi-seamless
  and seamless migration after state-preserving connection rebinding closed the
  remaining local handoff boundary.
  Common-Channel migration is now implemented as a strict connection-level
  boundary: MIGRATE accepts only NEED_FLUSH/NEED_DATA_TRANSFER, blocks later
  ordinary writes immediately, sends FLUSH_MARK before reading optional opaque
  MIGRATE_DATA, and rejects missing, unsolicited, or misordered state packets.
  The session waits for Main and every source child Channel before forwarding
  each opaque state body to its matching target connection and atomically
  adopting the target set. A partial flush followed by CANCEL reopens only the
  paused source connections and keeps the source usable. Prepared migration
  actors are no longer adopted: after an exact inventory check, authenticated
  target connections are rebound onto the existing Main, Display, Cursor,
  Inputs, Playback, Record, and passive actors. Source connections are then
  closed, preserving Display surfaces/image cache, Cursor cache/snapshot, Inputs
  button state, Main Agent token/decoder state, active audio state, and the shared
  multimedia clock. The Session image cache follows the same ownership boundary:
  seamless and semi-seamless rebinding retain it, while `SWITCH_HOST` performs
  full-session replacement and closes the source cache. The current
  warnings-as-errors gate passes, including `SpiceSessionTests` 62/62.

## Stage F peripheral-channel local closure

- Smartcard implements strict VSCARD 0.0.2 framing for reader/card/APDU/error/
  flush traffic, bounded payloads, a serialized control queue, migration-safe
  connection rebinding, and Session supervision. Reader and card ownership is
  application-explicit; the library never enumerates or opens host smartcards.
- USB redirection uses the generic SpiceVMC Channel plus an exact
  `libusbredirhost`/libusb C backend. It bounds every guest/host packet and pump
  interval, applies the guest filter, and requires an application-selected
  bus/address before opening a device. A raw packet bridge remains available to
  applications that own another backend.
- WebDAV strictly decodes Port initialization/events and incrementally
  demultiplexes bounded client streams. The optional native DAV class-1 server
  requires an explicit root, defaults to read-only, supports PROPFIND/GET/HEAD,
  and enables PUT/MKCOL/DELETE/file COPY/MOVE only under an explicit read-write
  policy. Canonical containment and symlink checks prevent root escape. The raw
  request/response bridge remains available when no native backend is attached.
- Session owns the optional USB/WebDAV backends, cancels pumps and clears client
  state on disconnect/failure, and preserves state across seamless connection
  rebinding. Focused tests prove that no card, USB device, or filesystem root is
  selected implicitly.
- Guest WebDAV mounting is live-closed on the independent Rocky x86_64 fixture.
  SwiftSpice authenticated through an SSH tunnel to QEMU 8.2.2 and
  spice-server 0.15.1, attached an explicit read-only root over
  `org.spice-space.webdav.0`, and an Alpine 3.22 guest running spice-webdavd
  3.0-r4 and davfs2 1.6.1-r2 completed both a direct HTTP GET and a davfs2
  mount/read. The guest observed 31 bytes with SHA-256
  `492d1e4f0bc7e1ce3ae8d06e597d4197dbe5029ff75956f720938f940499b297`.
  The reproducible, loopback-only fixture and lifecycle commands are under
  `Integration/RemoteRocky/WebDAV`; run evidence is stored remotely per run.

## Apple Silicon optimization acceptance status

- The 0.2 display refactor is locally covered for latest-only desktop delivery,
  hidden-demand snapshot suppression and full-damage resume, one-shot
  display-link scheduling, cursor-only updates, texture-cache bounds, two-frame
  GPU back-pressure, MJPEG handle/buffer reuse, pre-decode late drop, and typed
  VideoToolbox hardware/format failures. Its live 60-second idle/occluded CPU
  targets and the new active comparison against spice-gtk have not yet been
  measured; the older benchmark below is retained as historical evidence, not
  a result for the refactored presenter.
- The retained 2026-08-01 development-tree five-second Rocky smoke used an
  arm64 Release probe containing the then-uncommitted publisher revision-race
  fixes. It predates `v0.2.7` and is not current performance evidence. That
  probe published 52.0 fps versus 49.2 fps for spice-client-glib2, a passing 1.056911
  ratio. Ready-frame (0.772646), p95 (0.673903), and RSS (0.658301) also passed.
  Publisher stale snapshots fell from the earlier 48/261 (18.39%) sample to
  0/265. CPU per frame remained the blocking metric at 1.451688 ms versus
  1.206650 ms, a failing 1.203073 ratio. CPU materialization, pool exhaustion,
  GPU copy, GPU errors, and pending evictions were zero. Because the smoke still
  failed, the formal ten alternating pairs of 30 seconds were not started.
  Retained evidence, the tested probe hash, and exact collection paths are
  documented in `Benchmarks/RESULTS_ROCKY8_2026-08-01.md`.
- On the current M4 Pro host, the strict final-tree Rocky native-video gate
  passed both codecs. H.264 decoded 233 frames with 14 native Metal
  compositions; H.265 decoded 233 with 28 native compositions. Both selected a
  hardware VideoToolbox session and reported zero VT/general BGRA materialization,
  fallback, GPU error, stream-generation disable, and pool exhaustion. The
  server independently reported `selected=h264 streaming=1` and
  `selected=h265 streaming=1`.
- SwiftSpice now has an explicit Apple Silicon-only product contract: non-arm64
  compilation is rejected, native dependencies contain only arm64, release
  staging builds only arm64, and the closure verifier rejects any extra slice.
  The final `--package` gate passes with one arm64 executable slice, the staged
  shader bundle, recursive native-closure checks, and an ad hoc signature.
  There is no valid Developer ID identity on this host, so Developer ID signing,
  notarization, Gatekeeper distribution acceptance, and launch on a clean Apple
  Silicon macOS 26 machine remain external release gates.
- The current M4 Pro host (macOS 26.6, 24 GiB unified memory, 16-core GPU) has
  passed focused Metal/IOSurface tests, the hardware VideoToolbox gate, exact
  arm64 packaging, and a synthetic real-window Metal launch. M1 plus real-host
  1080p/4K, fixed 60 Hz/ProMotion, resize/occlusion, at least 95 percent source
  presentation, zero GPU errors, and zero normal-viewer BGRA materialization
  remain external acceptance gates. The current Apple/container live gate also
  still needs its custom KVM kernel and local QEMU image restored before rerun.

The listener-independent Stage F implementation is locally closed. The current
warnings-as-errors gate runs every test without exclusions. The current Rocky
yuv420p H.264/H.265 native composition gate is closed; broader codec profiles,
resolutions, and display behavior remain part of the real-host gate. Smartcard
hardware, a redirected USB device, human-audible Playback/device route
switching, physical microphone capture, and migration remain explicit external
gates rather than locally validated claims.

## Acceptance commands

The current trusted baseline passes warnings-as-errors tests without
exclusions, security-focused Clang analysis of the owned C shims, the complete
AddressSanitizer suite, and a 62 percent merged production-source line coverage
minimum. The `SwiftSpice` library build, generated-protocol consistency check,
and exact-arm64 native artifact closure verification also pass.

```sh
swift build --disable-sandbox -Xswiftc -warnings-as-errors
swift test --disable-sandbox -Xswiftc -warnings-as-errors
swift package --allow-writing-to-package-directory generate-spice-protocol --check
./Scripts/build-lib.sh
./Scripts/analyze-c-shims.sh
./Scripts/test-address-sanitizer.sh
./Scripts/check-code-coverage.sh
```

The repository-backed Apple/container live gate is:

```sh
Integration/AppleContainer/build-qemu-image.sh
Integration/AppleContainer/build-guest-initramfs.sh
Integration/AppleContainer/run-live-closure.sh

# Rich Agent closure (file transfer, clipboard, and two-head layout)
Integration/AppleContainer/build-agent-initramfs.sh
SWIFTSPICE_GUEST_INITRAMFS="$PWD/Integration/AppleContainer/Artifacts/agent-initramfs.cpio.gz" \
SWIFTSPICE_REQUIRE_AGENT=1 \
SWIFTSPICE_EXERCISE_FILE_TRANSFER=1 \
SWIFTSPICE_EXERCISE_CLIPBOARD=1 \
SWIFTSPICE_EXERCISE_MONITOR_CONFIGURATION=1 \
SWIFTSPICE_GUEST_SETTLE_SECONDS=5 \
Integration/AppleContainer/run-live-closure.sh
```

The live script requires the custom nested-virtualization kernel described in
`Integration/AppleContainer/APPLE_CONTAINER.md`. Its base gate validates ticket
authentication, Display/Cursor/Inputs observations, and guest receipt of the
injected physical A-key scan code. The richer opt-in gate additionally validates
Agent file transfer, bidirectional UTF-8 clipboard, QEMU UI-info monitor
