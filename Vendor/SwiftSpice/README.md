# SwiftSpice

SwiftSpice is a native Swift 6 implementation of the SPICE client protocol for
Apple Silicon Macs. The repository contains a reusable library, a SwiftUI/AppKit
viewer, and a command-line integration probe. It does not depend on GLib.

The protocol baseline is `spice-protocol` 0.14.5. The project currently covers
the core desktop path, compressed display formats, audio and Agent integration,
plus local groundwork for migration and peripheral channels. Features are only
advertised on the wire after their interoperability requirements are met.

## Project status

| Area | Current status |
| --- | --- |
| TCP/TLS, ticket authentication, Main Channel | Implemented and exercised against live QEMU/SPICE |
| Display, Cursor, physical keyboard and pointer input | Implemented and exercised against live QEMU/SPICE |
| RAW, JPEG, LZ, GLZ, ZLIB-GLZ, QUIC, and MJPEG display data | Covered by bounded decoders and offline golden fixtures; MJPEG streams reuse TurboJPEG and IOSurface-backed buffers |
| H.264 and H.265 | VideoToolbox decode and deterministic Rocky yuv420p interoperability are closed behind explicit opt-in; `.mjpegOnly` remains the default |
| Apple Silicon display path | Demand-driven revisioned IOSurface publication, display-link scheduling, native video composition, and direct Metal presentation are implemented; CPU/frame performance plus M1 and real 1080p/4K window gates remain pending |
| UTF-8 clipboard, file transfer, and monitor configuration | Implemented and exercised with the richer Agent guest |
| Playback and Record | Implemented locally; audible playback and microphone capture remain external hardware gates |
| Smartcard and USB redirection | Implemented locally; real devices remain external gates |
| WebDAV | Explicit-root server and guest direct GET plus davfs2 mount/read are closed against the Rocky fixture |
| Semi-seamless and seamless migration | Implemented locally; live migration interoperability remains pending |

SPICE input messages carry physical PC scan codes. They do not transport
Unicode text or synchronize an IME composition session. UTF-8 text uses the
separate SPICE Agent clipboard path.

QUIC images use the exact `spice-common` 0.42 backend supplied as a static
XCFramework by this package, behind a bounded C shim that owns
alignment and non-local error handling. GRAY, RGB16, RGB24, RGB32, and RGBA
have byte-exact fixtures; malformed payloads remain transactional at the
Display boundary.

See [Project status](docs/STATUS.md) for the detailed evidence and
pending gates.

## Requirements

- Apple Silicon (arm64); Intel Macs are not supported
- macOS 26 or later
- Swift 6.3 and Xcode 26.6
- The Xcode Metal Toolchain (`xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain`)

The package includes macOS static XCFrameworks for libjpeg-turbo, spice-common
QUIC, usbredir, and libusb. Supported SwiftPM builds select arm64; x86_64
builds are rejected. Builds do not require Homebrew or `pkg-config`. The
artifacts are reproducible from pinned, checksum-verified upstream sources with
`Scripts/build-native-dependencies.sh`; licenses and provenance are recorded in
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
The SwiftPM build-tool plugin compiles the package shader into a resource
`.metallib`; it does not search the working directory or Homebrew at runtime.

## Build and test

```sh
swift build --disable-sandbox -Xswiftc -warnings-as-errors
swift test --disable-sandbox -Xswiftc -warnings-as-errors
swift package --allow-writing-to-package-directory generate-spice-protocol --check
./Scripts/build-lib.sh
./Scripts/analyze-c-shims.sh
./Scripts/test-address-sanitizer.sh
./Scripts/check-code-coverage.sh
```

`build-lib.sh` builds the primary `SwiftSpice` library product for arm64 and
checks its native artifact closure. The repository's viewer is a debug and
integration client; it is not a packaged release product.

Build and run the viewer in a terminal while capturing stdout and stderr:

```sh
./Scripts/debug-run.sh
```

Set `SWIFTSPICE_SKIP_BUILD=1` to rerun the existing debug executable, and set
`SWIFTSPICE_LOG` to choose the log path.

The common commands are also exposed through the repository Makefile:

```sh
make help
make build
make test
make analyze
make sanitize
make coverage
make debug
make all
```

## Maintenance scripts

Check whether the selected Xcode, Swift, SDK, Metal toolchain, and checked-in
native artifacts are ready for development:

```sh
./Scripts/doctor.sh
```

Audit any built Mach-O or directory for Homebrew paths, other build-host
dependencies, and non-relocatable runtime search paths:

```sh
./Scripts/audit-dylib-links.sh Artifacts
```

The trusted local and CI baseline runs every test without exclusions, analyzes
the owned C shims with security-focused Clang checks, runs the complete suite
under AddressSanitizer, and requires at least 62 percent merged line coverage
across production sources. Tests, plugins, generated protocol declarations,
and build output are excluded from the coverage denominator. The unified CI
test executable is the canonical denominator; SwiftPM versions that emit
multiple test bundles can report a higher local percentage because they link a
smaller aggregate source set.

`VERSION` and the latest released `CHANGELOG.md` heading must agree. CI checks
them on every build and also checks a release tag:

```sh
./Scripts/check-version.sh
./Scripts/check-version.sh "v$(cat VERSION)"
```

To publish a release from a clean, synchronized `main`, run the full local
release gate. Add the release notes under `CHANGELOG.md`'s `[Unreleased]`
heading first. After confirmation, the script rolls those notes into the new
version, commits the two version files, pushes `main`, and pushes the tag that
starts the repository's GitHub Release workflow:

```sh
./Scripts/release.sh 0.3.0
```

## Use the library

Add the package and import `SwiftSpice`. A session owns the Main Channel and
attaches advertised child channels. `events` contains only ordered control
events. Desktop frames, cursor state, and pointer mode use a separate,
demand-driven latest-only source.

```swift
import SwiftSpice

let session = SpiceSession()
let endpoint = SpiceEndpoint(host: "127.0.0.1", port: 5930)
let info = try await session.connect(
    endpoint: endpoint,
    credentials: SpiceCredentials(password: "ticket-password")
)

let desktop = session.desktop.subscribe()
desktop.setDemand(.visible)
defer { desktop.cancel() }

for await snapshot in desktop.updates {
    if let update = snapshot.frame {
        print(
            "surface \(update.revision.surface.surfaceID) "
                + "revision \(update.revision.value): "
                + "\(update.frame.width)x\(update.frame.height)"
        )
    }
}

await session.disconnect()
```

`SpiceFrame` keeps immutable packed-BGRA semantics. For IOSurface-backed
frames, `pixels` performs one lazy CPU readback and caches it; Metal presentation
does not trigger that materialization. Public IOSurface frames expose metadata,
not a mutable IOSurface or CoreVideo handle.

`SpiceFrameUpdate.damage` describes changes since that subscriber's preceding
delivered revision. Lifecycle changes, insufficient retained damage history,
and resume after suppressed presentation produce `.full`. Setting demand to
`.none` keeps protocol drawing and the canonical surface current while avoiding
publication snapshots and drawable work.

On macOS, `SpiceDesktopView` presents frames and cursors and returns ordered
physical input events:

```swift
SpiceDesktopView(
    desktop: session.desktop
) { input in
    Task { try? await session.send(input) }
}
```

Optional host integrations are explicit. Applications decide when to attach
audio, microphone, pasteboard, file-transfer, USB, or WebDAV resources. In
particular, enabling clipboard synchronization allows guest text to reach the
general macOS pasteboard and may expose sensitive content.

Session and Agent diagnostics are opt-in pull snapshots. They contain aggregate
counters, gauges, and bounded timing histograms only:
`SpiceSession.diagnosticsSnapshot()` observes the display pipeline, while
`SpiceAgentManager.diagnosticsSnapshot()` observes capability-announcement and
inbound Agent message counts. Neither API retains clipboard text, file names,
credentials, frame pixels, per-frame timestamps, or error strings.
Agent snapshots also separate clipboard data, grab, request, and release
messages; expose only the peer's clipboard capability booleans; and classify
failures with fixed content-free categories. Counters cover the current Agent
manager lifetime, while capability and last-failure fields are its latest
observation.

`SpiceDesktopView` records presentation telemetry directly into its desktop
source, so the session snapshot separates publisher-emitted IOSurface/CPU-only
frames and Metal presentation versus AppKit CPU fallback. Fixed fallback
categories distinguish unavailable Metal, missing IOSurface backing, dimension
or pixel-format mismatch, and Metal texture creation failure. Content-free
timing summaries expose sample count, approximate p95, and maximum latency for
publisher scheduling/snapshot/emission, desktop-source coalescing,
view-to-Metal commit, Metal completion, and confirmed drawable presentation.

## Command-line probe

`spice-probe` checks a real SPICE listener. The ticket password comes from the
environment so it is not exposed in process arguments:

```sh
SPICE_PASSWORD='...' swift run spice-probe HOST PORT
SPICE_PASSWORD='...' swift run spice-probe HOST TLS_PORT --tls
```

Advanced video remains explicit: pass exactly one of `--enable-h264` or
`--enable-h265`; omitting both keeps the `.mjpegOnly` capability policy.

TLS uses normal system certificate validation. For a private modern PKI,
`TLSTrustPolicy.customCertificateAuthority` accepts DER or escaped PEM and its
`serverName` preserves normal hostname, SAN, and Server Authentication EKU
validation when the connection address differs. A virt-viewer file that pairs
`ca=` with `host-subject=` can use the separate compatibility policy without
weakening that modern contract:

```swift
.virtViewerCertificateAuthority(
    certificates: [Data(decodedCA.utf8)],
    expectedSubject: hostSubject
)
```

This policy still validates the caller-anchored chain and validity dates, then
matches the complete ordered leaf subject; it does not fall back to insecure
trust. The `--tls-insecure-for-testing-only` option remains limited to
self-signed local test servers.

For the nested QEMU live-validation harness, see the
[Apple/container guide](Integration/AppleContainer/APPLE_CONTAINER.md).
